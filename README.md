# Agent Connect Protocol Specification

## About The Project

This repo contains the specification of Agent Connect Protocol (ACP) proposed by the Agntcy Collective. The Agent Connect Protocol defines a standard interface to invoke and configure remote agents over an API. The protocol is specified in [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/what-is-openapi) a REST-based schema specification.

More about how ACP fits into the bigger picture of the [Internet of Agents as seen by Agntcy](https://docs.agntcy.org/index.html) can be found in the documentation [here.](https://docs.agntcy.org/pages/introduction.html)
