    description: >-
      Agents are AI workflows that can be configured and/or executed on this server. 
      This means that a client of this server can start a Run on any of the Agents supported by this server.

      Details of a supported agent are kept in an agent manifest.
      The agent manifest defines:
        - the schemas for configuration, input, output, and interrupts the agent expects or produces.
      
      See `Agent` and `AgentManifest` models below for more info.
  - name: Runs
    description: >-
      A Run represents an execution of an agent.

      The output of a Run can be a final result or an interrupt.

      Result from a run can be retrieved by polling or by blocking and waiting for the result.

      See `Run`  and `RunOutput` models below for more info.
  - name: Threads
    description: >-
      If supported by the agent, Run can be grouped in Threads.
      When a Run is created without specifying a Thread ID , a new thread is automatically created and a Thread ID is returned together with the created Run.
      At the end of the Run, the server keeps a thread state associated to the thread.

      When a Run is created specifying a Thread ID, the agent uses the previous state of the thread together with the provided input. 

      A run can be created on a thread **only** if there is no run in the `pending` status on the same thread. 

      Current thread state is accessible through this API.

      See `Thread` for more info.
